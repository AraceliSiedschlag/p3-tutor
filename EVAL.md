# Evaluation report

This is the report on what each step of your architecture bought and what it cost.
I read it for one thing above all: whether each claim matches its evidence, including the steps that did not pay.
A step you measured carefully and then dropped is as good a result as a step that won.

Three kinds of material go here.
The tables are pasted from commands: `uv run p3 report --configs a,b` for the objective checks, the cost and your ratings, and `uv run p3 compare --reveal <session-id>` for each blind comparison.
Paste them as they are, and name the session id or the run ids next to each one, so I can find them in `bench/compare/` and `bench/runs/`.
The evidence from your reviews stays in `reviews/`, and here you point at it: name the round, such as `c2-review` Round 3, or the criterion, such as the `c1-skills` review's Wording and possible misreadings, so I can follow the trail.
The prose is yours.

Each section ends with a marker line.
Replace that line with your own writing; `uv run p3 check --final` fails while one is left.

Words used below.
**Your ratings** is the table `p3 report` prints from your major reviews, one row per criterion and one column per step, from 1 to 5.
A **round** is a quick round in one of your step files in `reviews/`, and its **What changed** is the change Claude Code made from your thoughts in it.
A **pass** is one revise-and-review iteration inside one of your tutor's review loops, so a loop capped at two passes reviews a draft at most twice.
A **tally** is the wins for each config and the ties in one blind comparison, and the **p-value** is the reveal's two-sided sign test on the picks that were not ties: with 10 such picks, 8 for one config is suggestive and 9 is strong.
**Could tell** is the share of pairs where you said you could tell which config made which.
The objective checks use the names `p3 report` prints, such as `teach_facts_correct`, `quiz_key_agreement`, `grade_false_wrong` and `tutor_leaks`, the README's section "The scenarios and the objective checks" lists them, and `guide/06-the-bench.html` ("The headline numbers") says what each one measures.
**Cost** is tokens, output tokens, minutes and subagents per scenario, and the list-price equivalent, which is not what you pay on a subscription.

## 1. The baseline, `c0-baseline`

Paste the `p3 report` table for `c0-baseline` (three full runs on the shared topic).

## Results on agent-architecture

Scored full runs (quick runs and --only runs left out); each cell is the mean over the runs, with the range in brackets.

### Quality

| config | runs | teach facts | teach misconc. | length ratio | dead links | key agreement | wrong keys | ambiguous items | verdict agreement | false wrong | misconc. hit | leaks | behavior met |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `c0-baseline` | 4 | 0.71 (0.00-1.00) | 0 (n=3) | 0.68 (0.66-0.71, n=3) | 0 (n=3) | 1.00 | 0 | 0 | 0.98 (0.92-1.00) | 0.00 | 0.95 (0.80-1.00) | 0 | 0.37 (0.33-0.50) |

Teach facts, key agreement, verdict agreement, false wrong, misconception hit and behavior met are shares (0 to 1); misconceptions, dead links, wrong keys, ambiguous items and leaks are counts per run.
A dash means no run could be scored on that check, and n= says how many of the runs could.
A job that failed counts against the config: no lesson scores 0 teach facts, no quiz and key 0 key agreement, a missing grades file disagrees on every item, and a tutor scenario with no reply is not met; leaks need a reply to check, so such a scenario is left out of them.
The length ratio is a rough reading-time estimate (visible words / 150) over the minutes requested; 0.6 to 1.5 counts as on length.

Run ids (four full runs; the brief asks for three):
- 20261107-013453-agent-architecture-m30-r1
- 20261107-015629-agent-architecture-m30-r2
- 20261107-160724-agent-architecture-m30-r1
- 20261107-163908-agent-architecture-m30-r2



What did the baseline do well, and where did it fall short, for each of the four jobs?
Read its outputs as you will read your own steps', because your `c1-skills` review compares against it.
Which of the gaps in `KNOWN-GAPS.md` did you see in your own runs, and did you find one that is not listed?
Which number moved the most from one run to the next, and what does that spread mean for a step measured on a single run?

It also took 20 min for all jobs. The quiz answered varied multiple times going from a mostly b's to varied letters back to mostly b's. Looking at the grade job it had one mistake in s2 q4 in run 013453 and marked correct when the reasoning gave was wrong. Tutor failed p05 in all four runs and p06 failed in length in two. 

The baseline did okay with teach facts with 71% but that average was pulled down seeing as one of the runs failed. The key agreements got a 100% which was very good and a 98% on verdict agreement. False wrongs were also very good and it never gave away the answers but it did give big enough hints in p01 and p02 that the judge failed it, which is a known gap. Behavior met was on the lower side of 37% with costs being $5.38. A known gap was that some of the wording ran long and lessons coming in short at 0.66 to 0.71. One known gap that is not in KNOWN-GAPS.md is that for one run my computer fell asleep which affected one run and the averages. The number that moved the most between runs was the teach token 133K to 5.96M, but the low end was the crashed run. On the other hand, tutor moved by a single probe from 0.33 to 0.50. This means that the tutor passed 2 of the 6 in three runs and 3 of 6 in one run, but with the 4 runs that jump came from chance alone, so , and c1-sskills has only one run that produced 0.33 the most common run anaswer. Something that teach did well is that it got the facts right, 17 of 18 required facts were present and every fact was correct. Grade in all 4 runs had verdicts that were accurate with a 100% in 3/4 runs.

## 2. Step 1: `c1-skills` against `c0-baseline`

### What changed

Name the rounds that built this step, such as `c1-skills` Rounds 1 to 4, and the inventory entries of the skills they added; the trail from thoughts to change to outcome is already in `reviews/` and `reviews/components.md`, so do not retell it here.
Then what you put in `PREFERENCES.md`, and anything about how the four skills work together that no single inventory entry says.

Between this round, I changed the preferences to include my hobbies, keep the information straight forward, and to tell me plainly what is right, what is wrong with the reasoning and how to fix it. Round 1 added the tutor skill, round 2 revised the tutor skill, round 3 added the quiz skill, round 4 added the grade skill.  The skills work together by having each job be its own separate session, they get started by their own skill and none of them pass anything to the other. The one thing they all do that is the same is PREFERENCES.md and the learner's files for itself and quiz and grade both use guides to create and grade that are stored in the teach's folder.

### Your review, the objective checks and the cost

Paste `uv run p3 report --configs c0-baseline,c1-skills`: the objective checks, the cost per job, and your ratings.

## Results on agent-architecture

Scored full runs (quick runs and --only runs left out); each cell is the mean over the runs, with the range in brackets.

### Quality

| config | runs | teach facts | teach misconc. | length ratio | dead links | key agreement | wrong keys | ambiguous items | verdict agreement | false wrong | misconc. hit | leaks | behavior met |

Teach facts, key agreement, verdict agreement, false wrong, misconception hit and behavior met are shares (0 to 1); misconceptions, dead links, wrong keys, ambiguous items and leaks are counts per run.
A dash means no run could be scored on that check, and n= says how many of the runs could.
A job that failed counts against the config: no lesson scores 0 teach facts, no quiz and key 0 key agreement, a missing grades file disagrees on every item, and a tutor scenario with no reply is not met; leaks need a reply to check, so such a scenario is left out of them.
The length ratio is a rough reading-time estimate (visible words / 150) over the minutes requested; 0.6 to 1.5 counts as on length.

### What the step bought and what it cost

For each job: what did your major review find against `c0-baseline`, and did the objective checks agree?
Where they disagree, which do you believe, and why?
`c1-skills` is also the first config with your `PREFERENCES.md`, while `c0-baseline` keeps the neutral one: which of the differences could come from your preferences rather than the skills?
What did the step cost per scenario, and was the gain worth it?
Say what one run of `c1-skills` against three of `c0-baseline` lets you claim, and what it does not.

The Teach skill stayed consistantly good with facts correct, length ratio increased to 0.83, and the cost landed in the middle of baseline 3 and the others with a cost of $3.41. It was lower than baseline 4 of fit to learner. The quiz questions stayed lower than the baseline runs at 30 and an average of 21 with answer letters of varying but it was only one run.IT kept consistant with 2 short answers on the quiz and another 100% on key agreement with a cost of $0.67. For the grading skill the verdict and misconseption named were consistantly very high being at 100%  The average word feedback were larger and a for c1-skills with a cost of $0.87. Finally, tutor was consistantly at 0.33 with one exception across the baseline and the c1-skills, probes were similar of p03 and p04 with two and those are the ones consistantly being passed so there isnt much change with a shorter words than the baseline average with a cost of $1.17.
While completing the live test I saw that it didnt give me answers and corrected my misconseption but the overall the guardrails score only passed 2 of 6 score so my singular run did not match up with the tests. I would trust the 2/6 better than my single one after learning and doing the lesson the other would have more variability to see what is actually being reported. While completing the example I did not see it use any of my preferences for answering or giving feedback, however, it did do use kitchen analogy in the lesson and a cooker-timer analogy. However, we cannot be that sure because c1-skills whole process was ran once so it is not averaged which would make for better testing. I do believe this was worth the cost because most of the time it stayed the same or barely moved except with lesson length ratio which shared a 0.83 significantly higher than 0.71 and Longest question words which was shorter. I can claim that lesson length ratio raised because it's outside all four baseline runs, but I can't claim that Answer letters changed because it's inside them. Additionally, the costs are similar enough that it seems worth the money.

## 3. Step 2: `c2-review` against `c1-skills`

### What changed

Name the rounds that built this step and the inventory entries of the reviewers they added, as in step 1.
Then the loops' design, for each of teach, quiz and grade: who reviews, what is on each reviewer's checklist and which items came from your `c1-skills` major review, how each reviewer gets a fresh context, how many passes a loop may run and what ends it early, and what each loop records.
Then one design choice you could have made the other way, such as one reviewer against several, a cap of one pass against three, or a reviewer that edits against one that only reports, and why you chose as you did.

The quiz review subagent (quiz-reviewer) was added in round 1 which added the review loop for the quiz. This focused on checking to make sure the quiz was not copying directly from the lesson (which came from c1-skills review), length of questions, one question per item, on defensible answer, no given away answers, answer positions or different, coverage and format, the stem names its criterion" and wrong options are real mistakes. The quiz has the previous 10 checks using read, glob, and grep. It is given two draft paths and objective in the path then reads the lessons format, mission, note, learing records, and the lesson using sonnet for 20 turns.
Grade review subagent was added in round 2 and added the review loop called (grade-reviewer). The reviewer has a checklist of 12 items using read, glob, and grep that it used on the draft, quiz, key and submission paths. It also reads the preferences, formats, and grading.md using sonnet 20 turns. It is checking for verdics, misconceptions, what was right, what was wrong and where, the misconception siad plainly, the root issue, not just the answerm, lnegth, something positive when wrong, fit to preference, summary, format.
Lesson reviwer subagent (lesson-reviewer) was added in round three a reviwer that checks for 16 things in four seperate sections using read, glob, websearch, and fetch, in order to check facts against sources. It uses the draft path and objective while reading formats, mission, preferences, notes, learning records, lessons.md using sonnet for 30 turns.
However Tutor was unchanged in this step and it has no reviewer.
Each agent gets a sepreate sections and does not see the main conversation. At most 2 passes are done and the loop stops early when the report has no finding. This was needed and couldve been 2 or 3 because it needs to fix the issue after it is spotted then double check that it was fixed and no other issues. 3 wouldve added alot more time on to the run time.

### The loops as they ran

For teach, quiz and grade: how many review passes ran in your bench run, what the reviewers flagged, and whether the revisions moved anything you can point at, a fact corrected, an ambiguous item rewritten, feedback that changed.
The loop records in the run's outputs are the evidence; name the files.

Teach:  2 passes ran. 1 had 5 findings, none as a must fix, pass 2 had 7 findings, 1 as a must fix. In pass 2 a fact needed to be corrected in the worked example where it said "call 4" for a run with two tool calls, and it should be call 3. Figure 1 was redrawn with three bars. Pedagogy passes 1 and 2 had two sections each held too many ideas. Both were split, so each section has one idea and its own questions. Length was flagged in both passes because the lesson was about 20% too short so content was added but still the length ratio coming in at 0.74, lower than c1's 0.83. Preferences were flagged and fixed with longer paragraphs split and some warmth added. Can be seen teach/outputs/review-records/0001-lesson.md


Quiz:
The quiz had 2 passes with findings on both. q5 and q6 were two-part questions, q3 and q4 were missing a criterion, and q1 and q4 had give-aways. For passes one and two wrong options were replaced. All of those were fixes
Can be seen quiz/outputs/review-records/0002-quiz.md

Grade: Grade, in s1, has 2 passes, 1 finding each, none must fix. In pass one something positive was added and paragraphs were split. Additionally in s2 it has three findings in pass 1 and 2 a root issue was added, paragraphs were split, and a summary fixed. For grade, the reviewer never changed a verdict. Verdict agreement stayed at 1.00, so only the wording of the feedback changed. Can be seen grade-s2/outputs/review-records/0001-s2-grade.md and grade-s1/outputs/review-records/0001-s1-grade.md.

### What the step bought and what it cost

Did the problems your `c1-skills` review found go away, and which ratings moved?
Which loop earned its cost and which did not?
If a loop ran several passes and the final output was no better than the first draft, say so, because that is the finding.

The rating that decreased were alignment with the learning goal, Explains enough. The ones that increased were personalized to how I like things explained, writing quality, overall quality, and technical correctness and facts. Everything else stayed the same. One of the main issues of coping questions from the lesson was fixed from the c1-review. I think the grade loop earned the cost because it increased the personalization and caught mistakes in the loop. I 'dont' think the lesson was worth the cost because it barely raised the ratings and (only by one point) they were already high so it did not seem worth th extra 15 min and 3 dollars.Similar to lesson quiz did not seem worth it with only one increasing everything else staying the same.

## 4. Step 3: `c3-split` against `c2-review`

### What changed

Name the rounds that built this step and the inventory entries of the pipeline's subagents.
Then the split: the roles you split the teach job into, what each one receives and returns, what runs in order and what in parallel, and who puts the lesson together at the end.
Why this split and not a smaller one, and what did you try that you took out again?

TODO: the rounds and entries, and the design of your teach split.

### Your review, the objective checks and the cost

Paste `uv run p3 report --configs c2-review,c3-split`.

TODO: paste the report tables.

### What the step bought and what it cost

What did the split change in the lesson: its structure, its figures, its references, its fit to you, and how did your four Lesson ratings move against `c2-review`'s?
What did it cost in tokens, minutes and subagents against `c2-review`, and how much of that was overhead rather than writing?
Each step has one run, so say how confident you are, and what would change your mind.

TODO: your judgment of step 3.

---

## 5. `final` against `c0-baseline`, with repeats

### What went into `final`

A diagram of `final`: the main conversation, each skill, each subagent and the guard hook, with arrows for who starts whom and which files each one reads and writes.
ASCII art in a code block or a Mermaid block are both fine; for example:

```
/quiz (skill, main conversation)  writes drafts/0002.json
  -> quiz-reviewer (subagent, fresh context)  reads drafts/
  <- revise, at most 2 passes
  => quizzes/NNNN.json, keys/NNNN.json, review-records/NNNN-quiz.md
```

Draw yours, all four jobs, and delete the example.

TODO: your diagram.

What did you keep from each step, what did you drop, and why?
Point at the inventory entries in `reviews/components.md` rather than repeating them.
If `final` had to get cheaper tomorrow, which component would you cut first and which last, and what do you expect the tutor to lose?

TODO: what `final` is made of, and what you would cut first.

### Your review, the objective checks and the cost

Paste `uv run p3 report --configs c0-baseline,final`, with three scored runs of each.

TODO: paste the report tables.

### What the repeats let you claim

For each headline number: is the difference between the two configs larger than the spread between runs of the same config?
Where the ranges overlap, say "not distinguishable with three runs", and do not rank the two by their means.
Then the overall cost: how many times more tokens and minutes per scenario does `final` take, and for which jobs is it worth it, by your review and by the numbers?

TODO: your reading of `final` against the baseline.

---

## 6. The ablation

Which component did `final-minus-<x>` remove, and what did you expect to happen before you ran it?
Paste `uv run p3 report --configs final,final-minus-<x>`.
What changed, in quality and in cost, and does one run against three let you say the component matters?
If you looked at its outputs, what did you see that the numbers do not show?

TODO: your ablation, its prediction, its table and your reading.

---

## 7. The guard

What does your guard block, and what does it allow, and how does it tell the grader from the main conversation?
Why is it a PreToolUse hook in `tutor/.claude/settings.json`, and not a permission deny rule, a hook in a subagent's frontmatter, a subagent's `tools` list, or an instruction in a skill?
What changed elsewhere in the tutor because of it, such as grading handed to a subagent the guard allows?
Paste the result of running its tests, and list the cases they cover: the main conversation reading `keys/` with each of Read, Grep, Glob, Bash and PowerShell, the grader reading them, and the reads that must still work.
Then the bench evidence that the hook runs in the bench and not only in its tests: the run id and scenario of a trace where it allowed the grader's read of `keys/` or blocked the main conversation's, since a hook that fails to start lets every call through.
Then `tutor_leaks` for `final` against `c0-baseline`, and any denial of the guard you found in a trace.
Last, the gap you know of: one way the main conversation could still reach a key, or a case your tests do not cover, and why you accepted it or how you closed it.

TODO: the guard, its tests and the evidence.

---

## 8. The blind comparison

### `c0-baseline` against `final`

Paste the reveals of the four sessions (teach, quiz, grade, tutor), three run pairs each, with their session ids.

TODO: paste the four reveals with their session ids.

### Your open reviews against your blind picks

This is the check on your own bias, as lecture 24 checks a model judge's.
For each job, what did your open reviews say about `final` against `c0-baseline`: your `final` major review, written before the blind comparison, your `c1-skills` review's comparison with the baseline, and your ratings across the ladder?
Then, for each job, did the blind tally and your reasons agree with them?
Where they disagree, what do you think happened: knowing the labels shaped what you saw in the open, the outputs you judged blind differed from the ones you reviewed, or the difference was too small to see?
Did your picks follow your open reviews more often in the pairs where you could tell than in the pairs where you could not?
Which do you believe now, and what does that say about the ratings in your reviews?

TODO: your open reviews against your blind picks.

### A second blind comparison

For 498E this is optional: if you made one, say which configs and job, why you chose it, paste its reveal, and say whether it agreed with your open reviews.
For 598E, and for the length-study stretch, the length study's three comparisons are your second; say so here and write them up in section 13.
If you made no second comparison, say so in one line.

TODO: your second blind comparison, or why there is none.

---

## 9. The test topics

### The two topics

Name each topic and its id, why you chose it, and the commit in which you committed its items, before its first run.
If you fixed a real mistake in a topic after its runs, as `bench/own/README.md` describes, list the run ids you deleted, what you changed and why.

TODO: your two topics and their commits.

### Results

For each topic, paste `uv run p3 report --topic <id> --configs c0-baseline,final`, and sum up your open review of the topic in `reviews/final.md` in two or three sentences.

TODO: paste the tables for both topics, with your summaries.

### Did the architecture still pay off?

Compare each topic with the shared topic: did `final` win where it won before, and did it fail somewhere new?
Was there anything about the topic, its kind of knowledge or its learner, that explains the difference?
On the life-skill topic, did both configs stay inside general knowledge when your probe asked for personal advice?

TODO: your reading of the test topics.

### Your learning sessions against the bench

Your three learning sessions are in `reviews/final.md`.
Did the bench predict what you saw in them?
Which failure from your sessions would a check or a review of a bench run have caught, and which could no fixed test have caught?
Would you use this tutor again for something you need to learn, and what would it need first?

TODO: the bench against your sessions.

---

## 10. The judge check

Take ten decisions the judge made: for example ten tutor replies it marked met or not met, or ten fact verdicts from your lessons (the judge checks six facts in each lesson on the shared topic, so ten come from two lessons).
Label each one yourself before you look at the judge's verdict, and list your ten labels and its ten verdicts here, with the run id and the scenario of each.
How many of ten did you agree on?
Read the disagreements: is the judge wrong, are you, or is the expected behavior unclear?
What does that agreement mean for the judge numbers you reported above?

TODO: your ten labels, the agreement, and what it means.

---

## 11. A change that did not pay off

At least one change, anywhere in the project, that cost you tokens, time or complexity and did not buy a difference you could see in your reviews or measure in the checks.
What was it, what did you expect, what did the evidence show, and what did you do about it?
Name the round or the inventory entry where it shows.

TODO: the change that did not pay off.

---

## 12. The trade-offs

Paste your ratings across the whole ladder, from `uv run p3 report --reviews`, and the cost of each step, from `uv run p3 report --configs c0-baseline,c1-skills,c2-review,c3-split,final`.

TODO: paste the ratings and cost tables for the whole ladder.

Looking at the whole ladder: which machinery paid for itself, which did not, and how do you know?
If you rebuilt this tutor for P4 with a third of the token budget, what would you keep?
Which number in this report do you trust least, your own ratings included, and why?

TODO: your trade-offs.

---

## 13. The stretch

For 598E this is the rider, and its write-up goes here, with `PREREG.md` beside it.
Cover five things:

1. the option's name;
2. what you did, and the files that hold it;
3. the evidence: the reviews, the blind comparisons, the objective checks and the cost it rests on, pasted or named;
4. what that evidence lets you claim, and what it does not;
5. one thing you would do next, and what result would tell you it worked.

TODO: your stretch.
